            Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in our solar system. Adorned with a
            dazzling system of icy rings, Saturn is unique among the planets. It is not the only planet to have
            rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a
            massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. <br><br>

            Surrounded by more than 60 known moons, Saturn is home to some of the most fascinating landscapes in our
            solar system. From the jets of water that spray from Enceladus to the methane lakes on smoggy Titan, the
            Saturn system is a rich source of scientific discovery and still holds many mysteries. <br><br>

            The farthest planet from Earth discovered by the unaided human eye, Saturn has been known since ancient
            times. The planet is named for the Roman god of agriculture and wealth, who was also the father of
            Jupiter.</p>

         <p>
            With a radius of 3,959 miles (6,371 kilometers), Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial planets, and the fifth largest planet overall.

            From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), Earth is exactly one astronomical unit away from the Sun because one astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. This unit provides an easy way to quickly compare planets' distances from the Sun.
            
            It takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our planet.<br />

         <p>
            Saturn took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago, when gravity
                pulled swirling gas and dust in to become this gas giant. About 4 billion years ago, Saturn settled into
                its current position in the outer solar system, where it is the sixth planet from the Sun. Like Jupiter,
                Saturn is mostly made of hydrogen and helium, the same two main components that make up the Sun.

         <p>
            Like Jupiter, Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. At Saturn's center is a dense core of metals
                like iron and nickel surrounded by rocky material and other compounds solidified by the intense pressure
                and heat. It is enveloped by liquid metallic hydrogen inside a layer of liquid hydrogenâ€”similar to
                Jupiter's core but considerably smaller. <br><br>

                It's hard to imagine, but Saturn is the only planet in our solar system whose average density is less
                than water. The giant gas planet could float in a bathtub if such a colossal thing existed.

         <h1 id="Potential_for_life">Potential for Life</h1><br>
       <p>
        Saturn's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures and materials
        that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.
        <br><br>

        While planet Saturn is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true of some of
        its many moons. Satellites like Enceladus and Titan, home to internal oceans, could possibly support
        life.

       <p>Saturn is home to a vast array of intriguing and unique worlds. From the haze-shrouded surface of Titan
       to crater-riddled Phoebe, each of Saturn's moons tells another piece of the story surrounding the Saturn
       system. Currently Saturn has 53 confirmed moons with 29 additional provisional moons awaiting
       confirmation.
